// resolveSessionFileCallers is every file allowed to call an agent's
// ResolveSessionFile directly, with the reason it may.
//
// The method takes an agentSessionID that reached us from a hook payload or
// from checkpoint metadata on the shared entire/checkpoints/v1 branch, and
// several agents use it as a DIRECTORY component (Copilot:
// <dir>/<id>/events.jsonl) or return it verbatim when absolute (Codex, Pi). Its
// doc comment therefore says not to call it with unvalidated input — an
// invariant the compiler cannot check, and one that two agents violated for as
// long as it existed, because a new integration copies the nearest existing one
// rather than re-deriving whether the ID was checked.
//
// The fix for a new violation is not an entry here: it is
// SessionStore.SessionFile, which validates the ID and confirms the resolved
// path is inside the store, and which is what both former violators now use.
